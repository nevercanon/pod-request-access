## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

### Screenshot

I will add screenshots to my GitHub repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a bit difficult in figuring out placement of the background image and adjusting it based on the size of the layout. I wouldn't say it taught me anything new, but it helped me practice some techniques and find the better ways to position elements. Most of the rest of this project were things I've done multiple times before. I think it's definitely time for me to move up to projects with higher difficulty.

### Continued development

I'm going to start doing projects at the Junior difficulty now, to hopefully make my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript more solid. I'm excited to take this next step!
